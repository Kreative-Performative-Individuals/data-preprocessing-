# data-preprocessing-

In the repository you will find several documents. 

smart_app_data.pkl is the dataset that was provided to us.

In pipeline_prototype you will find a prototype of the pipeline that is not functional yet, but it represents the workflow for the cleaning, feature engineering and ML implementation. 

In preprocessing_functions the functions that are used in the preprocessing pipeline are implemented. Some of them are already there and were tested, others need to be implemented.

The other documents, such as data_exploration and statitistical_analysis, were only used to visualize and understand the dataset and how to work with it.
